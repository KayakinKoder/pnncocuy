			<p><strong>The answer</strong> to "When should I go?" is, well, when you're in Colombia! The high season is mid-December to early
			January; you shouldn't have a problem finding hiking buddies during this time. In fact, the park is so popular in December and January
			that you should seriously consider calling and reserving ahead if you're going to be staying in any of the cabanas
			or haciendas near the park. The hotels and hostels in El Cocuy and Guican generally do not fill completely up,
			but if there is a place you're set on staying while in town, call ahead. If you're planning on doing the 6 day
			trek during the high season, you shouldn't have a problem hooking up with a larger group (to cut down costs)
			in either El Cocuy or Guican. The guides in town will gather groups together, all you need to do is to let them
			know once you get to town you're interested in doing the big hike.</p>

			<p>December to March is also coincidentally the best time to visit the park in terms of weather. Because PNN El Cocuy
			is mountainous terrain, snow/rain/fog can happen at any time, but the December-March time frame is definitely
			your best bet for good, clear weather. Regardless of when you go, it will be cold. Check out the What To Bring section
			for more info on packing. Even in the cabanas and haciendas it's chilly; make sure to buy a hat and gloves (very
			cheap in El Cocuy or Guican) before you head up.</p>

			<p>If you're planning on visiting the park outside of the high season, all the better! Fewer people means more park
			to yourself. But if you want to do the 6 day trek, you may have a hard time hooking up with other people to split costs
			with. I'd suggest posting on the Lonely Planet forum, letting people know you're looking for people to do the hike with
			and when approximately you want to go. Of course the guides will not have a problem taking you alone on the 6 day trek,
			but it will be relatively expensive.</p>
